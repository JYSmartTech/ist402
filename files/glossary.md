## Front end Developer
A front end developer works on "front end" code in an application, commonly meaning the code that customers and product users interact with directly. A "front end dev" will typically write CSS, HTML and JavaScript in order to build complex interfaces for people to use. The front end development stack is always changing but tends to involve a front end library like Angular, React, Vue or Web components and a lot of backend knowledge in "tooling" like yarn / npm.

## HTML
When creating a website, HTML is a good language used on web pages. HTML elements is a type of code that made up of different sets of characters. They can also be called as tag. They usually defined as a starting tag which also has an ending tag at the end of the code, and the code between at is the main component of creating the website. HTML elements can have attributes and content, which can be headings, paragraphs, links, lists, embedded media, or any other format.
	HTML elements can placed into two different groups: block level and inline level. The former makes up the document's structure, while the latter dress up the contents of a block. In addition, Block elements occupy 100% of the available width and have a newline character before and after. Inline elements will only take up the space needed.

## IDE
IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. This software is used to debug, compile, and run the code. It is a software that can build applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface. IDE’s can support one or multiple languages of code. IDLE is an IDE that only supports python code. Visual studios, once downloaded the correct language, can support multiple languages.

## Angular
[Angular](https://angular.io/) is a popular TypeScript framework that is used to create web applications. It started out being used to make single paged applications but after the rapid growth in popularity of other JS frameworks such as React.js, it received many additional features to make it better suited for a variety of different application types. One of the things that Angular users particularly like is that Angular is based in TypeScript. A common criticism of JavaScript is the lack of type restrictions. In JavaScript a variable could be any type and a function could return any type but in TypeScript, these types must be predefined which helps provide clarity and assurance that the return data type of a function will always be the one desired.	

Another thing about angular that makes it appealing is that it is backed by Google which helps developers be more confident that Angular will be maintained for longer and receive more support throughout its lifetime. Angular is also an extremely popular framework and with popularity comes lots of contributions from other developers. Angular has thousands of different components that developers made and share which makes it very easy to get complex web components running on your own page just by bringing in the one the other developer made.

## React

React is a JavaScript library that is most prominently used for building interactive user interfaces for websites and applications. React was created in 2011 by Jordan Walker, a software engineer at Facebook, and the library was implemented into the company’s newsfeed the same year and Instagram’s the subsequent year. Facebook didn’t release React as we know it to the public until May of 2013, but ever since then it has been an open source software maintained by thousands of individuals.

Prior to the creation of React, developers had to essentially create user interfaces from scratch. This system was inefficient and it increased the risk of coding errors. Code within the React library is reusable and accessible to all, which effectively decreases development time and risk of programmer error. One of the major features of React is that developers can make large changes to their user interface components without reloading entire pages worth of content. This is most helpful when creating dynamic websites, where user interaction with the page is prominent. For some cool examples of sites that were built atop React, check out Netflix, Reddit, Dropbox, Facebook, and many more!

## Vue.js

Vue.js (pronounced the same as ‘view’) is a progressive Javascript framework used for developing user interfaces. Designed to be adoptable, Vue's basics are relatively easy to understand and can easily be integrated into existing projects and libraries. Vue enables developers to extend HTML and HTML attributes with directives, special tokens in markup that indicate how the library should handle certain Document Object Model (DOM) elements. Directives can be built-in or user defined.

Vue is similar to React in purpose, but each have different pros and cons. Ease of integration is a common praise for Vue and a less strict learning curve is also a relevant bonus. Vue was created by one man named Evan You and has always been open-source, relying heavily on community support. He created Vue to combine features from already popular frameworks like React and Angular.

## VirtualBox

VirtualBox or also known as Oracle VM VirtualBox is a free and open-source software for x86 and AMD64/Intel64 computing architecture virtualization. VirtualBox is a powerful product that is made for enterprise use as well as home use. VirtualBox can create a virtual machine by acting as a hypervisor and allows the user to run any operating system. VirtualBox provides a high level of features and performance for the customer of the enterprise available as Open Source Software.

VirtualBox runs on several operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and Solaris by hosting/supporting several amounts of the guest operating system. Overall, VirtualBox is a software that allows users to use an operating system on their own computer and get the experience of using it like it is actually on the real hardware system.
